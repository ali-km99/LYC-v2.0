      "In late 2015, Mr. Mahmoud Abdulrazzaq Bin Latif conceived the idea of establishing a club dedicated to the sport of sailing. A group of coaches and experienced individuals in marine sports and games, who had diverse and outstanding experiences in sailing, were immediately invited. They agreed to adopt the idea of founding a club and named it the Libyan Yacht Club, inspired by the first sailing club in history.",
      "The founders rallied to establish this club, aware of the absence of an institution that meets the needs of Tripoli in the field of marine sports. Motivated by patriotism, this founding group decided to work on filling this gap for Tripoli and its residents.",
      "The founders faced numerous challenges, the first of which was finding a suitable location and equipment to start. The search was arduous, spanning the Tripoli coastline. Many ideal locations were unavailable due to various complications. Finally, the founders found a suitable location with favorable terrain and support from local residents. This location became the club’s current headquarters in the Andalus Municipality, where work commenced in May 2016.",
      "بدأ العمل على الأرض في مايو 2016، وانطلقت اللجنة التسييرية برئاسة السيد هاشم عبدالرزاق الرعوبي بعد أن تم الإجماع عليه لقيادة دفة إدارة النادي. بدأت اللجنة بالعمل على تنفيذ أهداف النادي، وتم وضع خطوات تنفيذية لتحقيق هذه الأهداف.",
      "من خلال برامج تدريبية وتعريفية بالرياضة، تم إدراج مجموعة من البرامج لتغطية احتياجات الشباب من الناحية الفكرية، النفسية، والبدنية، وتنمية المواهب الرياضية، بالإضافة إلى حملات العمل التطوعي لخدمة المجتمع."
